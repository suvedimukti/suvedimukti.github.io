#### 1.) Land Use Land Cover Classification

The term Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) typically falls under the term [land use](https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/land-use#:~:text=%E2%80%9CLand%20use%E2%80%9D%20is%20the%20term,frequently%20represent%20very%20different%20uses.) classification. However, land use and [Land Cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_cover) are two seperate themes which are addressed under land-use classification. Some classification can have singel level level (e.g, two-class grassland or developed areas) while other may have multiple levels of classification. One example of latter is National Land Cover Dataset [NLCD](https://www.mrlc.gov/). Often time, these LULC products are based on coarse [spatial resolution](https://eos.com/blog/satellite-data-what-spatial-resolution-is-enough-for-you/#:~:text=Spatial%20resolution%20refers%20to%20the,30m%20area%20on%20the%20ground.) data. While these datasets offer great deal of information in policy making, ofthen times at local level thsese data doesn't alighn well with ground features. One way to deal with this problem is to use high-resolution 

### I am still working on it.... thanks for your interest
