I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of [Natural Resources Management](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/nrm/) at Texas Tech University, TX. I finished my undergraduate degree  in Forestry [B.Sc. in forestry](https://www.iofpc.edu.np/) from Tribhuvan University Pokhara Campus, Pokhara. I completed my Master's degree in Biology from [Texas A&M University, Kingsville](https://www.tamuk.edu/artsci/departments/biol/index.html). 

## BSc in Forestry [Awarded in 2010]
The Bachelor of Science in forestry is a four-year long undergraduate degree offered by Tribhuvan University. All courses/subjects execpt handful of subejcts on seventh semester are compulsory. Forestry education in Nepal is broad ranging from economics, accouting, social sciences, surveying, engineering and natural resources management. I chose Geographic Information System [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) as an elective course. During my B.Sc. education, I was part of several projecs where I:

- Mapped boundaries of community foreests using Global Positioning System (GPS) or compass (using angle and distance method).
- Assisted Community Forestry User Groups (CFUGs) to prepare working plans of their Community Forests.
- Conducted forest resources inventory of Lwang Unit (seven VDCS) under Annapurna Conseration Area Project (ACAP)
- Co-investigated community forest projects with in the framework of social inclusion, and *de-facto*and *de-jure* rules in community forests
- Served as a president of Self-Help Environment Awareness Camp[SHEAC] with a motto of "Think Global, Act Local"
- Performed an Undergraduate reseach on biomass estimation of Indian bay leaf <i> Cinnamomum tamala </i> using invasive sampling approaches

## MSc in Biology [Awarded in 2016]
During my master's degree, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Department of Biology, Teaching Assistant in the [Department of Physics and Geosciences](https://www.tamuk.edu/artsci/departments/phge/geo/index.html), and served as GIS manager at Geospatial Research Lab (GSRL).

I served as a Teaching assistant to:
<p> 1) Introduction to GIS [GEOL 5302] </p>
<p> 2) Advanced GIS        [GEOL 5313] </p>
<p> 3) Introduction to GIS for High-school Teachers, Summer[ 2015]</p>
<p> 4) Geospatial Technologies to Upward Bound Math-Science program's participants </p>

## PhD in Natural Resources Management [Awarded in 2022]
I am currently working in the Geospatial Technologies lab in the Department of Natural Resources Management at Texas Tech University. Currently,
I am working on large-area land use/ land cover mapping of 15 counties of Texas using very-high resolution (<1m) digital aerial photogrph collected through National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). I am using Geographicl object based image analysis (GEOBIA) techniques. Further, I am also utilizing time-series sentinel-2 data, and light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) data fusion on NAIP data. 

In short, I am involved in land use land cover mapping: 
- accounting spatial dependencis of data 
- employing widely used un(supervised) machine learning models in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/) environment 
- performing data-fusion
- deep-learning 

## Postdoctoral Associate [June 2022 - Present]

As a postdoctoral associate I am exploiting my Remote Sensing, GIS and Forestry related skills in asseessment of site productivity of sevearal pine species in the Eastern United States. I am using multispectral remote sensing data, Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI), LiDAR point cloud (LPC) and Forest inventory and analysis data.
  
I will post more about my on-going researches and projects as soon as my time permits, for details about my projects refer to **Research** tab. In the mean time, you can check my scholarly work at my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8hXlpL0AAAAJ&hl=en)
