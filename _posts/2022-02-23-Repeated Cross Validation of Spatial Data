# Repeated Cross Validation of Spatial Point Data for Tidymodeling
 [Mukti Subedi](suvedimukti@gmail.com)
 
This document shows the clustering of spatial point data to be used in a tidy modeling approach. 
Especially, It shows the 5-Fold Cross-Validation with 5-repeats as an example, using hierarchical and partitioning 
clustering in spatial point data. However, it does not include the source code, as it is part of a work in progress.
